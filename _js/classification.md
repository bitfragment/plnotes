JavaScript is an **interpreted** language like Java, Perl, and Python.

JavaScript is **dynamically typed** (no pre-declaration of a variable or declaration of its type is necessary).

JavaScript offers support for imperative, object-oriented, and function programming styles.

"JavaScript derives its syntax from Java, its first-class functions from Scheme, and its prototype- based inheritance from Self" (Flanagan, *JavaScript: The Definitive Guide,*, 1).

"JavaScript has long since outgrown its scripting-language roots to become a robust and efficient general-purpose language. The latest version of the language... defines new features for serious large-scale software development" (Flanagan, *JavaScript: The Definitive Guide,*, 1).
