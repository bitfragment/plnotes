Programming language notes.

These are written for my own use, not as a working programmer but as both a
hobbyist and a researcher, and made public not in the expectation that they'll
be useful to anyone else, but to impose a discipline on the writing making them comprehensible to me when I re-read them.

They're pitched at an intermediate level and focused on helping me retain what
I'm interested in: information about characteristic features and issues of
design and implementation of the most widely used general-purpose programming
languages.
