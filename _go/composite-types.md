## Arrays

* Arrays have a fixed length and are rarely used
* Syntax: `var a [3]int`
* Are subscriptable
* `len` returns the number of elements
* Initialization with array literal: `var a [3]int = [3]int{1, 2, 3}`
    - You can write an ellipsis instead of the length declaration:
      `var a [...]int = [3]int{1, 2, 3}`
* Arrays are comparable if their element types are comparable:
  `[...]int{1, 2, 3} == [...]int{1, 2, 3} // => true`
* Arrays are passed by value, not reference: a function receives a copy of an
  array argument, not a reference
    - If you don't want this behavior, you can pass a pointer to an array

## Slices

* A slice is a variable-length sequence that provides access to an underlying array
* A slice is composed of a pointer, a length, and a capacity
    - The *length*, accessed by `len()`, is the number of elements in the slice
    - The *capacity*, accessed by `cap()`, is the number of elements between the start of the slice and the end of the underlying array
* The slice operator `s[i:j]` creates a new slice referring to elements `i` through `j` of `s` (which could be an array, a pointer to an array, or another slice)
    - `s[:3]` includes elements from index 0â€“3
    - `s[3:]` includes elements from index 3 to the end of `s`
    - `s[:]` includes the entirety of `s`

You can *extend a slice* beyond its own length (though *not* beyond the capacity
of the underlying array):

```golang
x := [...]int{1, 2, 3} // [1 2 3]
y := x[:1]             // [1]
z := y[:2]             // exceeds y's length! => [1 2]
```
