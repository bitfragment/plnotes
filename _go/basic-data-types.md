Basic data types are boolean, numeric, string.

## Comparability

* All basic types are comparable using `==` and `!=`
* All basic types are ordered by comparison operators `<`, `>`, etc.

## Printing

* `fmt.Printf()` uses C-style specifiers
* Example: `fmt.Printf("%08b", 1)` â†’ print binary representation of int value 1,
  padding with zeroes to width of 8 ("00000001")

## Numeric types

* Implicitly signed and unsigned: `int`, `uint`
    - These are implementation-dependent platform-specific default or natural sizes (either 32 or 64 bits)
    - `int` is a different type than `int32`, even if they have the same natural size on a given platform. You will still need to convert them.
* Explicitly signed: `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`
    - Convention is to use these by default; use unsigned for binary operations
    - Use two's complement representation
* Explicitly unsigned: `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`
* `float32` and `float64`
    - Convention is to use `float64`
* `complex64` and `complex128`
* `byte` is for raw data, and is equivalent to `uint8`
* `rune` is for a Unicode code point and is equivalent to `int32`
    - Rune literals are single-quoted Unicode characters: `const x rune = 'ðŸ¤–'`
    - Use `fmt.Printf()` with `%c` to get character representation;
      `fmt.Print()` will print the integer code point value
* `uintptr` is for pointer values (implementation-dependent)
* `math.isNaN()`
* `math.NaN()` returns `NaN`, but don't compare it: comparisons always yield `false`

### Conversion

* Conversion using e.g. `int()`: 
  `const a int8 = 1; const b int16 = 2; const c int = int(a) + int(b)`

### Numeric operations

* `/` with two integer operands will truncate
* As binary infix operator `^` is bitwise XOR
* As unary prefix operator, `^` is bitwise negation or complement
* `&^` is AND NOT (bit clear)
* Left-shift zero-pads
* Right-shift of an unsigned value zero-pads
* Right-shift of a signed value pads with the sign bit

## Booleans

* Values of `bool` are `true` and `false`
* `!` is logical negation
* `&&` and `||` have short-circuiting behavior
* There is no implicit conversion from boolean values to `0` or `1` or vice versa

## Strings

* Immutable sequences of bytes, interpreted as UTF-8 encoded *runes*
* `len` returns **byte length**, not rune length
* `str[i]` returns *i*th **byte** where 0 <= `i` < `len(str)`, not necessary the *i*th character
* `str[i:j]` returns bytes from *i* to *j*
  - `str[:5]` returns from 0 to 5
  - `str[5:]` returns from 5 to end
  - `str[:]` returns a copy of `str`
* `+` is overloaded for string concatenation
* `==`, `<`, etc. compare in lexicographic order, byte by byte
* String literals are enclosed in double quotes
* Raw string literals are enclosed in backticks
  - They can spread over several lines of source code
  - They are useful for writing regexps, HTML templates, etc.
* `strings` provides string manipulation functions (e.g., `Contains`, `Count`, `Index`, `HasPrefix`, `Join`)
* `bytes` provides functions for working with byte slices (mutable, but otherwise like strings) --- many are counterparts of those in `strings`
* `strconv` provides string conversion functions (e.g., `Itoa` for int to ASCII. `ParseInt`, `FormatInt`)
* `unicode` provides rune classification functions (e.g., `IsDigit`, `IsLetter`)

## Constants

* Use `const` keyword
* Convention is to *not* write constant names in uppercase

Use the `iota` *constant generator* to create an enum. Here, `a` is assigned
the value 0, `b` the value 1, and `c` the value 2:

```go
const (
    a = iota
    b
    c
)
```
