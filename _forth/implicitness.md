## Forms

Implicitness is a core characteristic of Forth as a *word-based*
environment. Implicitness in Forth takes two forms: implicit calls and
implicit data passing.

### Implicit calls

Constants, variables, system functions and user-defined commands or
data structures are all called implicitly by name. No explicit call is
necessary.

### Implicit data passing

> The mechanism that produces this effect is Forth's data stack.
> Forth automatically pushes numbers onto the stack; words that require
> numnbers as input automatically pop them off the stack; words that
> produce numbers as output automatically push them onto the stack. The
> words `PUSH` and `POP` do not exist in high-level Forth [...] Forth 
> eliminates the act of passing data from our code, leaving us to
> concentrate on the functional steps of the data's transformation.
â€”Brodie, *Thinking Forth* 19-20

Here, `1` and `1` are automatically pushed onto the stack; `+` pops
two numbers off the stack and performs addition, pushing the result
onto the stack; and `.` pops the stack to display the result.
