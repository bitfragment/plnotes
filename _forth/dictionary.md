## Implementation

"The dictionary is a linked list of variable-length entries, each of which
is a Forth word and its definition [...] THe dictionary is searched by
sequentially matching names in source text against names compiled in the
dictionary" (Conklin and Rather, *Forth Programmer's Handbook* 19).
